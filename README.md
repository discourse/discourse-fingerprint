# discourse-fingerprint

Discourse Fingerprint comes as a tool to community managers in their combat with [internet trolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll). It works by computing a unique identifier (a fingerprint) of each registered user, by taking into consideration over 20 browser characteristics such as user agent, screen resolution, timezone, device memory, etc.
