        <p>
        A <i>hidden fingerprint</i> will not be shown in the <i>Latest Matched Fingerprints</i> section.
        A <i>silenced fingerprint</i> will cause all users with that fingerprint to be silenced on their next visit.
        </p>

        <p>
        Silencing a fingerprint should be used only as a last resort, as it is not guaranteed to always match the same user.
        For example, users with similar device configurations (same make and model) have a high chance of sharing a fingerprint.
